## Overview

BMX is a DeFi platform on Base, Mode, and Sonic offering spot, margin, and onchain media trading, requiring only a wallet connection to use. BMX currently offers 4 different products:

### wBLT
The flagship liquidity token for DeFi on Base. wBLT stands for wrapped BMX Liquidity Token and contains blue-chip assets such as cbBTC, ETH and USDC. wBLT receives a share of protocol fees harvested from trades routed through the liquidity token, as well as from inflows and outflows that maintain target weights. wBLT is a useful pairing asset on DEXes as well as pristine collateral for markets like Morpho.

### BMX Classic
A spot and margin trading platform based on GMX-v1 with a focus on capital efficiency and low fees. All trades are settled against a singular liquidity pool (BMX Liquidity Token - BLT) consisting of blue-chip assets, where a user can provide liquidity with any whitelisted asset, and in exchange, they receive LP tokens, representing their share in the diversified liquidity pool.

### BMX Freestyle
An intent-based trading platform with a focus on low fees and offering over 250+ trading markets, powered by the SYMMIO protocol.

### Based MediaX
An onchain avatar (NFT) and veAERO marketplace on Base with a fee of 1.9%, where listings with multiple avatars use Chainlink VRF to distribute randomly to buyers.

### Summary
**BMX** enhances the PDLPs (Perp DEX Liquidity Pools) model. By wrapping **BLT** into a Yearn-architected automated fee-processing vault (**wBLT**) and pairing it directly with **BMX**, the protocol eliminates the fight between trading liquidity and native token liquidity.

**BMX** improves capital efficiency for the protocol by eliminating competition between trading liquidity (**BLT**) and native-protocol liquidity (pool2), and supports increased protocol accrued fees through minting and redemption fees of **wBLT**, trading activity on intents-based Freestyle, as well as all NFT/onchain media activity on **Based MediaX**.

The most significant innovation is the introduction of **wBLT** as a product with multiple use cases built on top of automated fee-processing of **BLT**.

Some of the use cases are as follows:
- **wBLT-BMX** native protocol liquidity
- Pair with other assets (wBLT-(other asset)) which benefits protocols through **wBLT**â€™s automated fee-processing accrued fees in addition to the underlying **BLT** assets being an index of blue-chip assets
- Collateralize **wBLT** in lending markets like Morpho to continue to receive automated fee-processing accrued fees
- While borrowing against **wBLT** (Borrowing wBLT itself is disabled)
- Used as a payment option for protocol salary streams, or other products/services.
- BMX is comprised of a collective of contributors who are anonymous to one another and live all across the world, contributing to the success of the protocol alongside a powerful community. **BMX** is aligned to decentralization, self-custody, and on-chain actions, and never has access to or holds user funds.

Before launching **BMX** on Base, the team operated the Morphex protocol on Fantom and BNB Chain, where it facilitated over **$500 million** in total trading volume on Fantom and more than **$65 million** on BNB. These early deployments served as the foundation in building decentralized perpetuals and automated fee-processing vaults, directly informing many of the design principles now implemented in **BMX** including productive liquidity, modular architecture, and vault-first strategies.

We look forward to the future and from the team at **BMX**, thank you for taking the time to learn more about **BMX** and **wBLT** as a product. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to reach out in Discord or on X (formerly Twitter).
