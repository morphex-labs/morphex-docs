# BMX Staking: Governance and wETH Accrued Fees

### **Governance Participation**

BMX doubles as the protocol’s governance token. Whether you simply hold it or stake it for wETH accrued fees, or provide BMX in LP (which gives a 1.33x multiplier) every BMX in your wallet counts toward Snapshot voting power. Voting is gas‑free and executed off‑chain; passed proposals are enforced by the multisig.

### **Recent Decisions Directed by BMX Holders**

- **BIP‑12 – Fee Routing Realignment (Sept 2024)** → shifted Classic fee split to 70 % BLT / 20 % staking / 10 % wBLT‑BMX incentives. *Result*: 6.1 M votes, 92 % YES.
- **Mode Deployment Parameters (Dec 2024)** → set weight targets and open‑interest caps for BMX’s Mode chain launch.
- **Buy‑and‑Burn Budget Increase (Mar 2025)** → raised Freestyle’s BMX buy‑&‑burn allocation from 5 % to 10 % to accelerate supply deflation.
- **wBLT Mint/Redeem Fee Curve Update (Apr 2025)** → introduced a dynamic 0.15 % minimum fee to curb arbitrage gas wars.

### **Staking BMX**

Stake once, receive every week. A fixed slice of *each* product’s fee pool is converted to wETH and streamed to staked BMX. The slice size is product‑specific-

### **Fee Direction Per Product**

Below is the exact slice of each product’s fee pool that is redirected to the single‑staking contract *before* anything else (e.g., buy‑&‑burn or BLT vault funding) happens:

- **Classic** – **20 %** of every fee‑dollar generated from swaps, margin open/close, funding, liquidations, and BLT mint/redeem is swapped into wETH and streamed to BMX stakers.
- **Freestyle** – **30 %** of intent‑fill fees (0.10 % platform fee + funding differentials) is forwarded to stakers as wETH.
- **Based MediaX** – **60 %** of the 1.9 % marketplace fee on NFT / veAERO sales is converted to wETH for stakers.

*(For clarity: Freestyle also allocates an additional 10 % of its fees to buy‑and‑burn BMX, while MediaX allocates 5 % to the same. Those buy‑&‑burn percentages are **in addition to** the staking share listed above.)*

### **Where “the Fees” Actually Originate**

1. **Trading Economics (Classic)** – Every leveraged trade pays an open‑/close‑fee; swaps pay 0.20 – 0.80 %; liquidations recycle collateral into the pool. Twenty percent of that rainbow routes to single‑staking.
2. **Intent Engine (Freestyle)** – Instead of an order‑book, each filled intent pays a 0.10 % fee + funding differentials. Thirty percent of those fills show up in the staking contract.
3. **On‑chain Media (MediaX)** – Each avatar/NFT/veAERO sale pays 1.9 %. Sixty percent hits the staking pool; another 5 % buys & burns BMX.

### **Recent Numbers (8 h‑old Dune sample)**
| **Metric** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| Lifetime fees accrued | $2.45 M |
| Total BMX staked | 1,802,278 BMX |
| $ value staked | $3.13 M |
| Last‑week wETH to stakers | 7.32 wETH |
| Realised weekly historical APR | **15.5 % (annualised)** |

### **Multiplier Points: Fee Accrual Accelerator, Not a Token**

- Accrue at 100 % APR on your staked balance.
- Boost = MP / BMX (cap 100 %).
- Unstaking burns MPs → designed to favour sticky stake, not mercenary farming.

### **Dynamic Levers That Move Fee Accrual**

- **Volume mix** – A blow‑out week on MediaX (60 % share) can double effective fee accrual vs. a lull. Conversely, Mode/Sonic volume mostly flows through Classic (20 %).
- **Utilisation & Funding (Classic)** – High borrow utilisation raises funding payments → higher fee haul, same 20 % split.
- **Supply deflation** – Freestyle (10 %) & MediaX (5 %) spend part of their fee pool to buy & burn BMX. Fewer tokens means a thicker wETH slice per remaining BMX.

###Risks & Caveats
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fee downturn | wETH drip shrinks | Multi‑product design diversifies fee sources; MediaX uncorrelated with leverage vol. |
| ETH price crash | Dollar yield falls with ETH | Optional autocompound back into BMX to keep USD value steadier. |
| Short‑term staking | MPs get torched on exit → lower effective APR | Strategy aligns with long‑term holders. |
| Smart‑contract | Potential bug | Audits + multi‑sig gated upgrades. |

Bottom line: depending on where the user activity is—Classic, Freestyle or MediaX—between 20 % and 60 % of the fee torrent routes to stakers. That variability is why weekly APR prints can oscillate between single‑digits and north of 20 %. Track the Dune dashboard to help guide staking decisions.
