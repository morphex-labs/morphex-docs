#Introduction
BMX is a DeFi platform on Base and Sonic offering spot, margin, and onchain media trading, requiring only a wallet connection to use. BMX currently offers 4 different products:

wBLT: The flagship liquidity token for DeFi on Base. wBLT stands for wrapped BMX Liquidity Token and contains blue-chip assets such as cbBTC, ETH and USDC. wBLT receives a share of protocol fees harvested from trades routed through the liquidity token, as well as from inflows and outflows that maintain target weights. Fees are automatically processed; the historical annualised APR has averaged over ~30 % over the last 12 months (future rates may be higher or lower). wBLT is a useful pairing asset on DEXes as well as pristine collateral for markets like Morpho.

BMX Classic: A spot and margin trading platform based on GMX-v1 with a focus on capital efficiency and low fees. All trades are settled against a singular liquidity pool (BMX Liquidity Token - BLT) consisting of blue-chip assets, where a user can provide liquidity with any whitelisted asset, and in exchange, they receive LP tokens, representing their share in the diversified liquidity pool.

BMX Freestyle: An intent-based trading platform with a focus on low fees and offering over 250+ trading markets, powered by the SYMMIO protocol.

Based MediaX: An onchain avatar (NFT) and veAERO marketplace on Base with a fee of 1.9%, where listings with multiple avatars use Chainlink VRF to distribute randomly to buyers.

Pricing for the protocol is determined by price feeds directly from Chainlink (onchain) and Pyth (offchain) for the fastest and most accurate updates. As the protocol matures, governance will eventually decide most parameters.
