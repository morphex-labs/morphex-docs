## What is a wrapped-BLT? 
A wrapped-BLT is when you replace bread with a tortilla and wrap the bacon, lettuce, and tomato. It provides a different experience, generally less carbs and leaves you feeling lighter. Bread or tortilla, the choice is yours! At **BMX**, wrapped-BLT (**wBLT**) is a token received as a result of depositing **BLT** into **BMX**â€™s native *Yearn-architectured*, auto-compounding reward vault. **wBLT** functions as a receipt token representing a claim on the underlying **BLT** within the vault. 

How it works: **BLT** earns **70%** of protocol revenue streamed in **wETH**. When a user deposits **BLT** and receives **wBLT**, the vault manages these rewards for the user. The vault strategy *harvests* all rewards and converts proceeds into **BLT** tokens, then deposits them into the vault, increasing the total amount of **BLT** tokens within the vault in excess of user deposit amounts. **wBLT** is fully liquid, so users are able to withdraw their principal **BLT** and earned rewards from the compounding strategy at any time. By depositing into the vault, **wBLT** holders are able to auto-compound BLT-rewards. Auto-compounding is merely one benefit and use case that BMX has defined for **wBLT**. The power of **wBLT** is understood when you consider all of the use cases, which **BMX** has been defining and building. 

## wBLT as a Product
**wBLT** has many use-cases which are built on top of #1. Here are a few:
1. Auto-compounds underlying BLT asset rewards removing need to self-claim/exercise
2. Can be collateralized to allow for borrowing of bluechip assets, while continuing to auto-compound earned rewards, which has the ability to decrease collateral ratio over-time, functioning as a unique/hybrid type of self-repaying loan.
3. Paired as native BMX liquidity: wBLT-BMX continues to earn auto-compounding wBLT rewards (which represent 60% protocol revenue and 15% native oBMX emissions) in addition to: 30% protocol revenue streamed direct to LP gauge on Base-Velocimeter as wETH, 60% native oBMX emissions, 60% of option-revenue (more on this later), and 100% of oBVM (option-Base-Velocimeter) directed to wBLT-BMX gauge from veBVM voters.
4. Can be paired as a liquidity asset with other-tokens, providing multiple benefits:
    - Instead of pairing wETH-(native token), a protocol can deposit their wETH into BMX, obtain wBLT, earn their share of auto-compounding rewards and pair wBLT with their native asset to provide native protocol liquidity. This allows the protocol and their liquidity providers to earn their share of 60% BMX protocol revenue and 15% oBMX emissions as BLT, in addition to their native rewards.
    - By pairing with wBLT, a protocol is effectively pairing with an index of bluechip assets (wETH, wBTC, USDC) reducing risk of single-asset price impact on their native token liquidity.
    - When the value of wBLT increases this translates to positive price impact on the token it is paired with which is the same mechanism that allows wBLT to decrease collateral ratio overtime.
    - Generates additional trading revenue on the pair as wBLT can be arbed. Also, as it is arbed, mint and redeem fees may occur generating increased BMX protocol revenue, thus increasing auto-compounding rewards for wBLT.
