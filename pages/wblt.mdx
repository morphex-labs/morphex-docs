## What is a wrapped-BLT? 
A wrapped-BLT is when you replace bread with a tortilla and wrap the bacon, lettuce, and tomato. It provides a different experience, generally less carbs and leaves you feeling lighter. Bread or tortilla, the choice is yours! At **BMX**, wrapped-BLT (**wBLT**) is a token received as a result of depositing **BLT** into **BMX**’s native *Yearn-architectured*, auto-compounding reward vault. **wBLT** functions as a receipt token representing a claim on the underlying **BLT** within the vault. 

How it works: **BLT** earns **60%** of protocol revenue streamed in **wETH** as well as **15%** of native token emissions streamed in **oBMX** (more on **oBMX**, later). When a user deposits **BLT** and receives **wBLT**, the vault manages these rewards for the user. The vault strategy *harvests* all rewards and converts proceeds into **BLT** tokens, then deposits them into the vault, increasing the total amount of **BLT** tokens within the vault in excess of user deposit amounts. **wBLT** is fully liquid, so users are able to withdraw their principal **BLT** and earned rewards from the compounding strategy at any time. By depositing into the vault, **wBLT** holders are able to auto-compound BLT-rewards removing the need to self-claim and exercise **oBMX** themselves. Auto-compounding is merely one benefit and use case that BMX has defined for **wBLT**. The power of **wBLT** is understood when you consider all of the use cases, which **Morphex** has been defining and building over the past year. Before we begin defining them, let’s quickly review the history of how **Morphex** created **wBLT**. 

## History of Morphex’s Implementation of Native Yearn-Architectured Vaults

**Morphex** on **Fantom** launched **wMLP** (same as **wBLT**) vault live on 05/01/23 which continues to operate today without issue, currently with *greater than* **$500k TVL**. At time of writing, **Morphex** on **Fantom** remains the *largest perpetual trading platform* on **Fantom** by TVL size and margin trading volume. **wMLP** vault was designed by **Morphex** and developed in collaboration with a native **Yearn Finance** core contributor, who is now also a core contributor for **BMX** by **Morphex**. Additionally, **Morphex** on **Fantom** was the first protocol to collateralize GLP-equivalent liquidity via a vault token when it listed **wMLP** on a Fantom-native money market, which allowed users to borrow bluechip assets against **wMLP** with conservative loan-to-value ratios scaling from 20% to 60% over a few months. *Borrowing wMLP itself was intentionally disabled due to the inherent risk that would present. 

Morphex launched **wMLP-USDC** as a liquidity-paired asset on **Fantom-Velocimeter** (**FVM**) as an experiment in utilizing the vault token as a liquidity paired asset. **wMLP-USDC** continues to operate today without issue, currently with greater than **$35k TVL**. The vault strategy continues to convert **FTM** rewards into **MLP**, which increases the amount of **MLP** each **wMLP** can claim. Additionally, users who paired their **wMLP** with an equivalent amount of **USDC** and provided **wMLP-USDC** on **FVM Exchange**, have been able to earn additional **wMLP-USDC** rewards from **FVM** in addition to vault rewards.

**Morphex** on **Fantom** proved the concept that perpetual trading liquidity can be both collateralized and utilized as a liquidity-paired asset, to increase capital efficiency. **BMX** by **Morphex** builds on these innovations through additional improvements in protocol design and capital efficiency for reward distribution and tokenomics, to create and introduce capital-efficient perpetual trading liquidity as a product: **wBLT**!

## wBLT as a Product
**wBLT** has many use-cases which are built on top of #1. Here are a few:
1. Auto-compounds underlying BLT asset rewards removing need to self-claim/exercise
2. Can be collateralized to allow for borrowing of bluechip assets, while continuing to auto-compound earned rewards, which has the ability to decrease collateral ratio over-time, functioning as a unique/hybrid type of self-repaying loan.
3. Paired as native BMX liquidity: wBLT-BMX continues to earn auto-compounding wBLT rewards (which represent 60% protocol revenue and 15% native oBMX emissions) in addition to: 30% protocol revenue streamed direct to LP gauge on Base-Velocimeter as wETH, 60% native oBMX emissions, 60% of option-revenue (more on this later), and 100% of oBVM (option-Base-Velocimeter) directed to wBLT-BMX gauge from veBVM voters.
4. Can be paired as a liquidity asset with other-tokens, providing multiple benefits:
    - Instead of pairing wETH-(native token), a protocol can deposit their wETH into BMX, obtain wBLT, earn their share of auto-compounding rewards and pair wBLT with their native asset to provide native protocol liquidity. This allows the protocol and their liquidity providers to earn their share of 60% BMX protocol revenue and 15% oBMX emissions as BLT, in addition to their native rewards.
    - By pairing with wBLT, a protocol is effectively pairing with an index of bluechip assets (wETH, wBTC, USDC) reducing risk of single-asset price impact on their native token liquidity.
    - When the value of wBLT increases this translates to positive price impact on the token it is paired with which is the same mechanism that allows wBLT to decrease collateral ratio overtime.
    - Generates additional trading revenue on the pair as wBLT can be arbed. Also, as it is arbed, mint and redeem fees may occur generating increased BMX protocol revenue, thus increasing auto-compounding rewards for wBLT.
