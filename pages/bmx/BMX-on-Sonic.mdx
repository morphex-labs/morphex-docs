## BMX on Sonic

BMX has deployed a wrapped Sonic Liquidity Token (wSLT) on Sonic, along with other perpetual market services. wSLT currently contains wETH, USDC and Sonicâ€™s native S.

BMX token supply is unchanged, and users can easily bridge from Base to Sonic through Transporter, powered by Chainlink CCIP. Bridge BMX now with this pre-populated direct link: https://app.transporter.io/?from=base&tab=token&to=sonic&token=BMX

Stay tuned as wSLT expands utility on Sonic. If you are a protocol or user on Sonic and believe wSLT would be a good fit in your ecosystem, please reach out in the BMX Discord.
